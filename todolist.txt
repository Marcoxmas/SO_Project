Implement the swapping mechanism second chance, using the read and write bits
if write bit set in ram_frame, it needs to be updated in swap space, if not no need
more refined testing to prove that swapping works as intended (not random)
implement required functions, wrap swapping inside MMU_exception function
place the page table inside ram (beginning) in init function, setting frames affected as unswappable

ADD A LOGGING SYSTEM TO NOT DUMP ALL IN TERMINAL
